# ABSTRACT


The study examines the impact of corporate governance on financial performance among firms listed on Portugal’s PSI-20 index. Drawing on agency theory, stewardship theory and resource-dependence theory, the research investigates how board characteristics, specifically board size, board independence and gender diversity, influence firm performance. The analysis employs panel data from PSI-20 companies over a multi-year period, utilizing econometric models including Hausman’s specification test to determine the appropriate fixed or random effects approach.
The findings reveal mixed relationships between governance mechanisms and financial performance metrics, including return on Assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Board independence contradicts prior literature by showing a negative relationship, meaning independent directors may negatively influence financial performance. The results regarding board size and gender diversity present nuanced insights, reflecting the complex interplay between governance structures and firm outcomes in the Portuguese context.
This research contributes to the limited empirical literature on corporate governance in Portugal. The study addresses the research gap concerning governance-performance relationships in the Portuguese market and provides practical implications for policymakers, regulators and investors. The study acknowledges limitations including sample size constraints and suggests avenues for future research across broader market contexts.


# DATA AND METHODOLOGY

# 3.0 DATA AND SAMPLE SELECTION
The study uses a quantitative research design to investigate the relationship between corporate governance and financial performance of firms listed on the Portuguese stock market. The PSI-20 index, which comprises the largest and most liquid companies listed on Euronext Lisbon, makes up the sample. The PSI-20, which comprises companies from a variety of industries like energy, telecommunications, retail and manufacturing, is widely recognised as a trustworthy proxy for the Portuguese equities market.
The study produces a balanced panel dataset for the years 2019 through to 2023. In addition to reflecting current corporate governance procedures after the Portuguese Securities market Commission (CMVM) reinforced governance regulations, this era was chosen to guarantee data availability and consistency. To preserve data integrity, companies who made incomplete financial or governance disclosures during that time were not included. Thus, out of the 15 firms listed on the PSI-20 index, only 14 were included in this study. 
While corporate governance information was gathered from corporate governance reports that were either submitted with the CMVM or published with annual reports, financial information was gathered from firms consolidated financial statements and annual reports. To guarantee accuracy and comparability across companies and years, all data were manually collected.
# 3.1 VARIABLE DEFINITION
# Dependent Variables
Firm financial performance is measured using two accounting ratios, Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). Return on assets is calculated as net income divided by total assets. Return on assets measures the efficiency with which a firm utilizes its assets to generate profits. Return on Equity is also calculated as net income divided by shareholders’ equity. Return on equity reflects profitability from the perspective of shareholders. These measures are commonly used in empirical corporate governance literature due to their ability to capture operational and managerial performance.
# Independent Variables
Corporate governance is proxied through board characteristics, which are among the most frequently studied governance mechanisms. Board Size (BSIZE) is measured as the total number of directors serving on the board each year. Board Independence (BIND) is measured as the number of independent non-executive directors. Gender Diversity (GDIV) is measured as the number of female directors on the board. These variables capture the monitoring capacity, diversity perspectives and decision-making effectiveness of corporate boards.
# Control Variables
To isolate the effect of corporate governance on performance, several control variables are included. Firm Size (FSIZ) is measured as the natural logarithm of total assets. Leverage (LEV) is measured as total debt divided by total assets, capturing financial risk.

# 3.2 ECONOMETRIC MODEL
The study uses a panel data regression model to investigate how corporate governance affects firm performance. By combining cross-sectional and time-series data, panel data methods increase estimation efficiency and permits the control of unobserved firm-specific factors.
The baseline regression model is specified as follows:
Y_it=β_0+β_1 〖BSIZ〗_it+β_2 〖BIND〗_it+β_3 〖GDIV〗_it+ β_4 〖FSIZ〗_it+ β_5 〖LEV〗_it+ ε_it 

Where:  
Y = Performance variables (ROE and ROA); β_0,β_1,β_2,β_3,β_4,β_5 = Constants; BSIZ = Board Size; BIND = Board Independence; GDIV = Gender Diversity; FSIZ = Firm Size; LEV = Leverage; ε_it = Error term

 3.3 DATA ANALYSIS
The study will utilize statistical techniques to analyse the data gathered i.e. Panel Data Regression. Statistical instruments which will be utilised include tables, which will display an easy-to-read and understandable picture of data acquired ad further explain the analysis performed. The method of examination of the data will be done with the assistance of Microsoft Excel and R-studio.
 
 # RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS
# 4.0 INTRODUCTION
This Chapter has been used to present and analyse hypothetically the data obtained and as well as discuss the results and findings. The chapter presents on the descriptive statistics; correlation analysis and the regression analysis of data collected from the stated listed companies on the PSI-20. 
# 4.1 DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
The financial performance measures reveal moderate profitability among PSI-20 firms. The mean ROA of 0.06(6%) indicates that, on average, firms generate six cents of profit for every euro of assets deployed. The standard deviation of 0.06 suggests substantial variation in asset utilization efficiency across firms, with performance ranging from slightly negative (-0.02 or -2%) to highly profitable (0.4 or 44%). This wide range reflects heterogeneity in operational efficiency, industry characteristics, and strategic positioning among PSI-20 constituents.
The mean ROE of 0.20 (20%) indicates that firms generate, on average, a 20% return on shareholder equity. The higher ROE relative to ROA is consistent with the use of financial leverage, as reflected in the mean leverage ratio of 0.70. However, ROE exhibits greater variability (standard deviation of 0.20) and a wider range (-0.45 to 1.33) compared to ROA, suggesting that equity returns are more sensitive to capital structure decisions and financial risk. The negative minimum ROE (-0.45) indicates that some firms experienced substantial losses relative to equity during the study period, potentially reflecting the impact of economic downturns or firm-specific challenges.
PSI-20 firms have an average board size of 13.40 directors, with substantial variation (standard deviation of 4.37) ranging from small boards of 3 directors to large boards of 21 directors. This mean is considerably larger that the 7-9 member boards often cited as optimal in Anglo-American governance literature but is consistent with patterns in continental European markets characterized by stakeholder representation and two-tier board structures. The large standard deviation suggests that Portuguese firms adopt diverse board size strategies, potentially reflecting differences in firm size, complexity, ownership structure and regulatory requirements.
The mean number of independent directors is 4.17, with a standard deviation of 2.47 and a range from 0 to 10 independent directors. Given the average board size of 13.40, this translates to approximately 31% board independence on average. This level of independence is below the 50% threshold commonly recommended by international governance codes and mandated in some jurisdictions. The presence of firms with zero independent directors indicates that some PSI-20 companies maintain boards dominated by executive and affiliated directors, consistent with concentrated ownership structures where controlling shareholders may prefer limited independent oversight. This pattern aligns with prior research documenting that Portuguese governance practices lag some European markets in board independence(Fayyaz et al., 2023).
PSI-20 firms have an average of 3.44 female directors per board with a standard deviation of 1.36 and a range from 0 to 6 women. Given the average board size of 13.40, this represents approximately 26% female representation, which is notable and suggests that Portuguese firms have made progress on gender diversity. This level exceeds the critical mass threshold of 20% identified in prior literature as necessary for meaningful influence (Carmo et al., 2022; Pereira & Paoloni, 2019). However, the presence of firms with Zero female directors indicates uneven adoption of diversity practices. The relatively high mean gender diversity compared to international benchmarks may reflect Portugal’s comply-or-explain governance code recommendations on diversity, stakeholder pressure or voluntary adoption of best practices.
The mean firm size (natural logarithm of total assets) is 7.62 with a standard deviation of 1.78, indicating substantial variation in company scale among PSI-20 constituents. This heterogeneity is expected given that the PSI-20 includes both large multinational corporations and smaller domestic firms. Firm size is included as a control variable because larger firms may have different governance needs, greater resources for governance investments and different performance characteristics compared to smaller firms.
The mean leverage ratio 0.70 indicates that PSI-20 firms finance, on average, 70% of their assets through debt. This relatively high leverage is consistent with Portugal’s characterization as a banking-oriented market where firms rely heavily on debt financing (Neves, Proença, et al., 2023). The standard deviation of 0.17 and range from 0.07 to 0.97 indicate variation in capital structure choices, with some firms maintaining conservative low-debt strategies while others operate with high financial leverage. Leverage is controlled for because capital structure influences both financial performance and potentially governance structures.

# 4.2 CORRELATION ANALYSIS
Correlation basically measures the inter relationship among two or more variables. It determines the linear dependency among variables and the mutual relationship between variables (Gogtay & Thatte, 2017). However, correlation associations do not mean causality i.e. if X affect y or vice versa. 
The strong positive correlation between ROA and ROE (r=0.84) indicates that firms performing well on asset utilization also tend to generate strong equity returns. This high correlation is expected, as both measures capture profitability, though from different perspectives. The strength of this relationship suggests that operations performance translates into shareholder returns, with leverage amplifying or dampening this translation.
Board size exhibits negative correlations with both ROA (r= -0.20) and ROE(r= -0.26), suggesting that larger boards are associated with lower financial performance in the bivariate analysis. This preliminary finding is consistent with agency theory predictions that coordination costs, communication difficulties and free-rider problems increase with board size, potentially reducing governance effectiveness. However, these modest correlations do not account for other factors and multivariate regression analysis is necessary to assess whether board size independently influences performance after controlling for firm characteristics.
The correlation between board independence and ROA is negative (r = -0.28) while the correlation with ROE is positive (r= 0.22). This divergent pattern is noteworthy and suggest that the relationship between independence and performance may differ depending on how performance is measured. The negative ROA correlation is unexpected from an agency theory perspective, which predicts that independent directors enhance monitoring and improve performance. The positive ROE correlation is more consistent with theoretical predictions. These contradictory bivariate associations underscore the importance of multivariate analysis that controls for confounding factors.
Gender diversity shows a weak positive correlation with ROA (r =0.06) and a moderate positive correlation with ROE (r = 0.29). the stronger association with ROE suggests that gender diversity may be more closely related to equity returns than asset utilization efficiency. This pattern is consistent with prior Portuguese research finding stronger diversity effects on market-based performance measures (Pereira & Paoloni, 2019). The positive correlations provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that gender diversity enhances performance, though the modest magnitudes suggest that effects may be contingent on other factors.
Board size exhibits moderate positive correlations with board independence and gender diversity, which is expected since larger boards have more positions available for independent and female directors. The correlation between board independence and gender diversity is also positive and moderate, suggesting firms that prioritize independence may also emphasise diversity, or that both reflect broader governance quality orientations. These intercorrelations are important for regression analysis, as they indicate potential multicollinearity that should be assessed when including multiple board characteristics as independent variables.
Firm size shows positive correlations with board size, board independence, and gender diversity, consistent with the expectation that larger firms have larger, more diverse boards with greater independent representation. This reflects both regulatory requirements and the greater complexity and resources of larger firms. Leverage shows weak correlations with most variables, suggesting capital structure is relatively independent of board composition in this sample.
The correlation analysis provides preliminary evidence that board characteristics do not exhibit strong linear relationships with financial performance in PSI-20 firms. However, correlation analysis examines only bivariate relationships and does not control for other factors. Multivariate regression analysis is necessary to assess whether board characteristics influence performance when controlling for firm size, leverage, and other factors.

# 4.3 REGRESSION ANALYSIS
The aim of the regression analysis is to determine the impact of one variable (independent variable) on the other variable (dependent variable). This implies looking at the effect of the independent variables (board size, board independence and gender diversity) on the dependent variables (return on assets and return on equity). There are different ways of estimating a panel data model depending on the assumption made. The two most used models are the fixed effect model and the random effect model (Hausman, 1978). To determine which of the model is appropriate for this study, Hausman’s specification test was employed.

# 4.3.1 HAUSMAN’S SPECIFICATION TEST
In panel data (analysis of data over time), the Hausman specification test is used to choose between fixed effect model and random effect model (Hausman, 1978). To facilitate the test, two hypotheses are set: the null hypothesis (H_0 ) and the alternative hypothesis (H_1).
H_0= Random Model is appropriate
H_1= Fixed model is appropriate
The thumb rule for the test state that, if the chi-square statistic is significant at the 1%,5% or 10% level (less than 1%,5% or 10%), the null hypothesis is rejected, implying that the random effect estimator is not appropriate for modelling the data and fixed effect should be preferred (Hausman, 1978).

Hausman Specification test ( ROA model)
Prob > chi-square	0.156

Hausman Specification test (ROE model)
Prob > chi-square	0.1842

The Hausman Specification tests for both the ROA and ROE models yielded non-significant chi-square statistics (p>0.05). Hence, the null hypothesis that the Random Effects estimator is consistent could not be rejected. Therefore, Random Effects models were adopted for subsequent analysis.
# ROA REGRESSION RESULTS
The model explains 15.95% of ROA variation (Adjusted R-square = 0.1595) with overall statistical significance (p = 0.006042), indicating governance variables collectively influence profitability, though other factors remain important. Board size has a positive coefficient with p-value = 0.064, which is marginally significant at the 10% level. This means that each additional board member increases ROA by approximately 0.43 percentage points. This contradicts the correlation analysis, suggesting a non-linear or conditional relationship. Board Independence has a negative coefficient suggesting that each additional director reduces ROA by 0.75 percentage points which may further suggest potential agency costs or conservative decision-making that limits aggressive profit-seeking, however this is statistically significant at the 5% level with a p-value of 0.032. Gender diversity however shows a positive coefficient, but this is not statistically significant. Both control variables firm size and leverage have a negative coefficient and marginally significant at the 10% level  

# ROE REGRESSION RESULTS
The model explains 12.29% of ROE variation with statistical significance (p = 0.019), indicating weaker explanatory power compared to the ROA model. Board Size shows a positive relationship but is not statistically significant, showing that board size matters less for equity returns than for asset efficiency. Board Independence however still shows a negative coefficient which is statistically significant, indicating that each additional independent director reduces ROE by 2.38 percentage points reinforcing that independence may limit aggressive profit strategies. Gender diversity showed a positive coefficient, but this is not statistically significant. Control variable, firm size, has a negative relationship which is statistically significant while leverage has positive relationship, but this is not statistically significant. 

# 4.4 IMPLICATIONS
 Investors should critically evaluate firms with very high board independence. While independence is traditionally viewed as good governance, these results suggest excessive independence may reduce profitability by limiting management’s operational flexibility and risk-taking capacity. The optimal board likely balances independence with industry expertise and entrepreneurial orientation.
The lack of significant impact from gender diversity suggests investors should not use board composition as a primary screening criterion for financial performance. However, diversity may provide other benefits not captured in short-term profitability metrics. The Marginal positive effect of board size on ROA suggests moderate expansion may be beneficial but optimal size appears to be 12 to 15 members based on the sample mean and positive coefficient. Additional members should bring specific value-adding capabilities.
 
#  CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS
# 5.0 CONCLUSION
This study examined the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on financial performance among PSI-20 listed firms in Portugal. The following research questions have been addressed.
Research Question 1: Does board size affect firm performance in PSI-20 companies? The regression results shows that Board size demonstrates a statistically significant relationship with firm performance when measured by ROA, though the effect is only marginal and does not extend to ROE. These findings indicate that board size does influence performance in PSI-20 firms, but its impact is sensitive to the specific performance metric and likely conditional on broader governance characteristics. Accordingly, H1 is partially supported. Board size matters, but its optimal level and performance implications appear contextual rather than universally positive or negative
Research Question 2: Does board independence affect firm performance in PSI-20 companies? Board independence exhibits a statistically significant negative relationship with both ROA and ROE. This finding directly contradicts agency theory predictions and rejects Hypothesis H2, which proposed a positive relationship. The negative coefficients indicate that higher proportions of independent directors are associated with lower financial performance in PSI-20 firms.
Research Question 3: Does gender diversity on boards improve firm performance in PSI-20 companies? Gender diversity shows no statistically significant relationship with financial performance. The coefficients are positive but insignificant for both ROA and ROE. Therefore, Hypothesis H3 is not supported. Despite PSI-20 firms averaging 26% female board representation, exceeding the 20% critical mass threshold identified in prior literature, this diversity does not translate into measurable financial performance improvements.

# 5.1 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
Several limitations should be acknowledged. The sample size of 70 firm-year observations is modest, limiting statistical power to detect relationships. The cross-sectional design cannot establish causality or capture dynamic relationships that may unfold over time. The measurement of board characteristics using simple counts may not capture governance quality or board effectiveness. Other important governance mechanisms (ownership structure, board processes, management quality) are not measured. Performance is measured using accounting-based metrics (ROA, ROE) which may not fully capture firm value or long-term performance.

Future research should address these limitations through longitudinal designs that track governance and performance over time, qualitative research examining governance processes and board dynamics, more nuanced measures of governance quality beyond compositional variables, investigation of alternative governance mechanisms including ownership structure and bank relationships, and broader performance measures including market value and stakeholder outcomes. Comparative research across countries with different institutional contexts would further illuminate how governance-performance relationships vary with institutional factors
