The study examines the impact of corporate governance on financial performance among firms listed on Portugal’s PSI-20 index. Drawing on agency theory, stewardship theory and resource-dependence theory, the research investigates how board characteristics, specifically board size, board independence and gender diversity, influence firm performance. The analysis employs panel data from PSI-20 companies over a multi-year period, utilizing econometric models including Hausman’s specification test to determine the appropriate fixed or random effects approach.
The findings reveal mixed relationships between governance mechanisms and financial performance metrics, including return on Assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Board independence contradicts prior literature by showing a negative relationship, meaning independent directors may negatively influence financial performance. The results regarding board size and gender diversity present nuanced insights, reflecting the complex interplay between governance structures and firm outcomes in the Portuguese context.
This research contributes to the limited empirical literature on corporate governance in Portugal. The study addresses the research gap concerning governance-performance relationships in the Portuguese market and provides practical implications for policymakers, regulators and investors. The study acknowledges limitations including sample size constraints and suggests avenues for future research across broader market contexts.
